        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>I use a data-driven approach, guided by user input, to solve real issues. With a background in evolutionary anthropology, I strive to reach the core of the problem by facilitating conversation, listening intently, and monitoring and decipherig behavioral ques to assess the core components users require to operate the design seemlessly.</p>

        <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
        <p>I then incorporate what I've learned through user interview and usabilitiy testing to establish a clear, conceptual design, followed by iterations influenced by more user imput. This allows for the final prototype to address the unique needs of the users.   </p>
